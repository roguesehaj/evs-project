        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        
        <p>Plastic has become an integral part of modern life, offering convenience and accessibility in countless aspects of daily tasks—from packaging and household items to medical equipment and electronics. Its lightweight, durable, and versatile nature has fueled widespread use and dependency across industries and communities. However, the very attributes that make plastic so useful also contribute to its persistence in the environment, creating a significant environmental challenge.</p>

        <p>As plastic production has skyrocketed globally, the improper disposal and management of plastic waste have led to severe consequences for ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. When not adequately recycled or managed, plastic accumulates in landfills and natural environments, breaking down into microplastics that infiltrate soil, waterways, and even food sources. Marine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable, with approximately 8 million tons of plastic entering oceans each year, where it poses lethal threats to marine animals, disrupts habitats, and contaminates food chains.</p>
            
        <p>This project aims to explore the complex journey of plastics—from their beneficial applications to the devastating environmental impacts they impose. We focus on the entire lifecycle of plastic, from production and consumption to waste management. Special emphasis is given to marine pollution, where plastic debris severely harms biodiversity, and to greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global climate change. In response, this project highlights the critical importance of adopting the RRR (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) model, advocating for sustainable practices that minimize waste, conserve resources, and reduce the environmental footprint of plastics. By shifting towards more sustainable consumption and waste practices, we can begin to mitigate the long-term effects of plastic on our planet.</p>
